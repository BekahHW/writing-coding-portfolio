    <h1>The Scars That Make Us Beautiful</h1>
    <p>This trauma memoir explores the damage done when doctors don’t believe their patients, when questions are unanswered, and when no one wants to help. It tells of the power of community, empathy, and growth when you’re fighting to figure out who you are in your post-trauma world, and gives hope for a future where you are thriving, not just surviving. </p>
