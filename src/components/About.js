  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>After working as an adjunct English teacher for ten years, I experienced a trauma while having my fourth kid. After major surgery, I found coding calmed the trauma that was going on in my head. I could focus on the errors, on creating, on learning. I was hooked. So I left my adjunct position and with the Facebook + Flatiron Emerging Scholars Scholarship attended and completed Flatiron School Bootcamp.</p>
  <p>My favorite parts of learning to code have been the problem-solving and community (as I also have a background in community organizing).</p>
